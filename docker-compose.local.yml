  # 🗄️ LOCAL POSTGRES DATABASE
  # ============================================
  # Ephemeral container seeded with test data
  # Data persists via named volume (removed with docker-compose down -v)

  # Need to push the userId and Password to applicaiton, but in production we will use secrets
  # Local DEVELOPMENT DATABASE ONLY - Ephemeral, seeded with test data
  postgres-local:
    image: postgres:15-alpine       # Lightweight PostgreSQL
    container_name: seat-saga-db
    # 🔐 DATABASE CREDENTIALS (Local-only hardcoding)
    # ❗ These are SAFE because:
    # 1. Only runs on localhost (127.0.0.1:5432)
    # 2. Never pushed to production
    # 3. Reset with `docker-compose down -v`
    environment:

    # 🔌 NETWORK EXPOSURE (Security: localhost only)
    # 5432:5432 → Exposes PostgreSQL to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), accessible from any host on the network
    # 127.0.0.1:5432 → Only accessible from your machine
    # 0.0.0.0:5432   → Accessible from network (insecure for local)
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:5432:5432"              # Secure: localhost only

    # 💾 DATA PERSISTENCE
    # Named volume preserves data across container restarts
    # Remove with: docker-compose down -v
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Named volume 'pgdata' persists data even if the container is removed.

    # 🌐 NETWORK CONNECTIVITY
    # Important: We tell the local DB to join the Base Network so that they can talk(present in docker.compose.yml)
    networks:
      - app-network        # Join app's network
    # 🩺 HEALTH CHECKING
    # Ensures Postgres is ready before app starts
    healthcheck:
      # 'pg_isready' checks if Postgres is accepting connections.
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U myuser -d mydb" ]
      interval: 5s   # Run health check every 5 seconds
      timeout: 3s    # Fail if check takes more than 3 seconds
      retries: 20    # Mark container as unhealthy only after 20 failures

    # 🔄 4. RESTART POLICY (Development mode)
    # "no" -> If the app crashes, stop the container.
