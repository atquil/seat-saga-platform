    # 🔐 DATABASE CREDENTIALS (Local-only hardcoding)
    # ❗ These are SAFE because:
    # 1. Only runs on localhost (127.0.0.1:5432)
    # 2. Never pushed to production
    # 3. Reset with `docker-compose down -v`

    # 5432:5432 → Exposes PostgreSQL to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), accessible from any host on the network
    # 127.0.0.1:5432 → Only accessible from your machine
    # 0.0.0.0:5432   → Accessible from network (insecure for local)

    # 💾 DATA PERSISTENCE
    # Named volume preserves data across container restarts
    # Remove with: docker-compose down -v
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data # Named volume 'pgdata' persists data even if the container is removed.

      timeout: 3s    # Fail if check takes more than 3 seconds
      retries: 20    # Mark container as unhealthy only after 20 failures
